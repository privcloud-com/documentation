Container permissions apply to the container itself and any associated records within that container so any object criteria not applicable to that scope is ignored. (EX: Rules about user objects or record type objects.) Container permissions are great for setting restrictions around how a container's contents can be accessed since a deny rules ALWAYS take precedence over allow rules. It is also possible to set allow rules within container permissions.",
