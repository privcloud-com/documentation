Deny permissions ALWAYS take precedence over allow permissions. In this case, this permission is allowing the user dtijerina-cannotaccessQ1Records@privcloud.com or the application app-integration-cannotaccessQ1Records these privileges. Once this permissions is created, it needs to be assigned to a role and then the role granted to dtijerina-cannotaccessQ1Records@privcloud.com or the application app-integration-cannotaccessQ1Records.",
